  <p class="body">The venue of the conference will be announced shortly! Thank you for your patience.</p>



<!-- <p class="body">We are pleased to announce that the 5<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow (HTFF'18) will be held in Italy, Rome on August 16 - 18, 2018 at the Barceló Aran Mantegna.</p>

<p class="body">The Barceló Aran Mantegna is located in EUR-Garbatella, Rome's business district, surrounded by green spaces and very close to the city's new exhibition centre, the Nuova Fiera di Roma. The hotel's location ensures that it is always peaceful, but it is also well-connected to the city centre and Fiumicino and Ciampino international airports. There is a bus stop nearby which links the hotel to the centre of Rome, as well as all kinds of shops, banks, restaurants, and cafés.</p>

<p class="body">Rome, Italy’s capital, is a sprawling, cosmopolitan city with nearly 3,000 years of globally influential art, architecture and culture on display. Ancient ruins such as the Forum and the Colosseum evoke the power of the former Roman Empire. Vatican City, headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, has St. Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Museums, which house masterpieces such as Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel frescoes.</p>

<p class="body">Rome can be reached very easily via its airports (Leonardo da Vinci and Ciampino), by rail (the two large stations, Termini and Tiburtina), and even by sea (the ports of Ostia, Fiumicino and Civitavecchia). </p>
