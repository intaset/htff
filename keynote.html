  <p class="body">Dr. Gergely Kristóf earned his MSc degree at the present Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME). In his PhD thesis he developed a two-fluid model for the expansion of partially ionized pellet clouds in hot fusion plasmas. He is currently associate professor at the Department of Fluid Mechanics of BME. Dr. Kristóf has a 16 years practice in the industrial application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), participated in about 300 industrial consultancy projects in several application fields, such as atmospheric flows, porous media flows, heat exchanger modeling, building services engineering, water treatment, hydraulics and pipe transients. He also played a significant role in the introduction of CFD into the Hungarian higher education. He is member of ERCOFTAC and the Scientific Advisory Committee of Von Karman Institute.</p>
