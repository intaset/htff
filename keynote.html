  <p class="bold">Dr. Chamil Abeykoon</p><img src="../img/Abeykoon.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Chamil received his BSc (Hons) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka with the award of best performance in Mechanical Engineering in 2007. Then, he received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering in 2011 from the Queens University Belfast, UK with several publications where one of his publications was awarded with a young author best paper award from the IEEE in 2011. After having a few academic positions, Chamil joined the Faculty of Science and Engineering of University of Manchester (UoM) as an Assistant Professor in October 2015. Currently Chamil is working mainly with the Northwest Composts Centre and the Aerospace Research Institute of the UoM. So far, he has authored 35+ peer-reviewed journal/conference papers. Moreover, he is the author of the monograph Polymer Extrusion: A Study on Thermal Monitoring Techniques and Melting Issues. His research interests include: Process Monitoring, Modelling and Control; Soft Sensors and Soft Sensing; Process Instrumentation; Energy Efficiency; and Heat Transfer. At present, he is mainly researching in the areas such as melt flow behaviour in polymer processing, 3D printing, development of inferential (soft) sensors for processing applications, heat transfer (heat flow and cooling) in gas turbine applications. He is an associate member of the IESL, IMechE, ICPM and also a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy UK.</p>

<!--   <p class="body">Dr. Yuwen Zhang is a James C. Dowell Professor and Chairman of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of Missouri, USA. His research interests are in the areas of thermal-fluids science and engineering, including ultrafast and high-energy laser materials interaction, multiscale transport phenomena in multiphase systems, inverse problems and optimization under uncertainty, micro- and nanoscale heat transfer, and sustainable and renewable energy. He has published five books, over 260 journal articles, and more than 155 conference papers/presentations. He is recipients of the Young Investigator Award from the US Office of Naval Research, Senior Faculty Research Award from the College of Engineering in University of Missouri, as well as the Chancellor's Award for Outstanding Research and Creative Activity from the University of Missouri (2010). He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). He is the Co-Editor-in-Chief for two international journals, as well as editorial board members of other 10 international journals.</p> -->
