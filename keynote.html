  <p class="body">Thom Adams is currently Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, USA. He earned his BS in Mechanical Engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and his MS and PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Having won multiple best paper awards for his work in technical research as well as engineering education, he is one of only a handful of faculty ever to have received both the Institute’s Outstanding Scholar Award and Outstanding Teaching Award. His early work in single-phase and two-phase heat transfer in microchannels represents some of the seminal work in the field. He has since become a leading educator in the field of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and has authored a first of its kind textbook on the subject aimed at an audience of undergraduate technical majors regardless of specific discipline. His current research focuses on what he calls the “scholarship of generalisation,” in which physical systems and processes are purposely modelled using the most fundamental concepts and methods available in order to ascertain physical trends and correlations that often go unnoticed when relying solely the techniques of modern specialized research.  </p>

 <p class="body">Professor Huihe Qiu is currently Head of Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST) and Director of the Building Energy Research Center (BERC) of the HKUST Nansha Fok Ying Tung Graduate School. Professor Qiu received his Ph.D. degree from Institute of Fluid Mechanics, LSTM, at the University of Erlangen, Germany in 1994. Professor Qiu’s research areas are in, multiphase flow and heat transfer, fluid dynamics, optical diagnostics, nano- and microfluids and flapping wing aerodynamics. Professor Qiu is Editor-in-Chief/Editor/Associate Editor of four international journals and a member of the editorial board for more than 10 international journals, such as the members of Editorial Advisory Board of Experiments in Fluids. He has been invited to give 21 plenary and keynote speeches in International Conferences. He is the recipient of the Best Paper Award of Institute of Physics (IOP) in 1994, Philips Outstanding Paper Award in the International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology and High Density Packaging (2012), ASME Best Poster Award (2010), Best Paper Award, 2nd World Congress on Mechanical, Chemical, Material Engineering (2016), Best Paper Award, 4th International Conference on Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow (2017), The State Scientific and Technological Progress Award (SSTPA) and the Scientific and Technological Achievement Award from the State Education Commission.</p>

 <p class="bold">Dr. Louis Gosselin</p> <img src="../img/Gosselin.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img"> 
 <p class="body">Louis Gosselin is currently a professor of mechanical engineering at Université Laval in Quebec City, Canada. He received his bachelor’s degree in physics from Université de Sherbrooke (Canada) and his master’s degree in chemical engineering from the same institution. He obtained his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Duke University (USA) in 2004. 
Professor Gosselin has been involved in a number of collaborative research projects with the industry on energy efficiency and energy management in buildings and in industrial processes. His research interests include the modeling and optimization of heat transfer and thermodynamics systems. Recently, he worked on geothermal energy, waste heat recovery, primary production of aluminum, smart control of thermal systems, advanced building envelopes, demand-side management, solid-liquid phase change, impact of humans on energy efficiency, thermal storage, and energy issues in the high north.
From 2012 to 2019, he held the Chair in educational leadership on sustainable engineering at Université Laval. Louis Gosselin is a registered P. Eng. in the province of Québec.
