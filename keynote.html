<!--   <p class="body">Dr. Yuwen Zhang is a James C. Dowell Professor and Chairman of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of Missouri, USA. His research interests are in the areas of thermal-fluids science and engineering, including ultrafast and high-energy laser materials interaction, multiscale transport phenomena in multiphase systems, inverse problems and optimization under uncertainty, micro- and nanoscale heat transfer, and sustainable and renewable energy. He has published five books, over 260 journal articles, and more than 155 conference papers/presentations. He is recipients of the Young Investigator Award from the US Office of Naval Research, Senior Faculty Research Award from the College of Engineering in University of Missouri, as well as the Chancellor's Award for Outstanding Research and Creative Activity from the University of Missouri (2010). He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). He is the Co-Editor-in-Chief for two international journals, as well as editorial board members of other 10 international journals.</p> -->
